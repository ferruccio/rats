# Rats
This is an attempt to re-create the game of Rats, which I first played more than forty years ago on a Convergent Technologies IWS Workstation.

After a little searching, I ran across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqMuL_LlP4) which has helped to jog my memory in terms of
both graphical appearance and game-play mechanics.
